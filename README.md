Tic-Tac-Toe User Manual

Welcome! Here is a guide on how to operate our Tic-Tac-Toe program.
Let’s start off with some things to take note of:

-	Try clearing the console & resetting before you start every new game. This will ensure that (hopefully) no errors occur.
-	The [X] symbol is always assigned to the player (user) and [O] is always assigned to the computer.

How to Play:

  Here is a grid to help you visualize which number corresponds to what space:

  1.	The choice to go first will be randomized.

  2.	If it is your turn, (in the console) you will be prompted the following: “Make your move.” Input a number from 0 to 8 that corresponds to the space you wish to make your move on. The grid will be visualized after you make your move.
    a.	If it is not your turn, then the same prompt will appear, along with the number the computer chose. In addition, the grid will be visualized and a [O] will appear on the space the computer took.

  3.	The above will repeat until either the player (user) or computer wins. To win, line three of your X’s in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (like in a traditional tic-tac-toe game). If you take too long to win, the computer might take it from you! Good luck!
